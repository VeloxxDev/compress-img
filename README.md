Histogram Project — Computer Science Foundations
ENSICAEN — 2025
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and transforming color images using histogram‑based techniques.
The main objectives are to:
- compute RGB histograms
- perform color quantization (popularity algorithm)
- map quantized colors back onto the original image
- generate transformed images and associated statistics
The project emphasizes algorithmic rigor, memory‑safe C programming, and clear justification of methodological choices.

Main Features
✔️ RGB Histogram Construction
- Separate histograms for Red, Green, and Blue channels
- Count of occurrences for each intensity value (0–255)
✔️ Popularity‑Based Color Quantization
- Sort colors by frequency
- Select the k most frequent colors
- Reduce the image palette while preserving dominant tones
✔️ Color Mapping
- Assign each pixel to the closest quantized color
- Reconstruct a simplified but visually coherent image

🧪 Test Images
The images/ directory contains:
- simple test patterns (gradients, solid colors, shapes)
- more complex images for robustness testing
- output images generated by the program
